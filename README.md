# system-prompts

A repository for managing LLM system prompts and engineering rules.

## Purpose

This repository contains system prompts and development standards used to guide AI coding assistants. The primary artifact is `RULES.md`, which defines engineering principles and quality standards for all projects.

## Structure

- `RULES.md` - Development Manifest & Engineering Principles containing mandatory workflow and quality standards

## Usage

These rules are loaded by AI coding assistants to ensure consistent engineering practices across projects. The rules cover:

- Git and commit conventions
- Communication and collaboration guidelines
- Design and problem-solving approaches
- Coding standards and reliability patterns
- Testing and verification strategies
- Modern logging practices
